# Shop API

This is a carlessly written simple API that is implemented using [Spring Boot] and some of its associated project. The running application has been hosted on the [Open Shift(r) RedHat(r) Cloud][open shift]. [Spring Boot] is a nice little handy framwork that I have workd with and it is giving us the freedom to build quick and robust applications. This project was mainly created to learn the following concepts in around [Spring Boot].

1. [Swagger]
2. [Spring Testing]
3. [Spring Security]
4. [Spring Boot MVC Jackson]
5. [JMS consumer and producer using Apache ActiveMQ]
6. [Spring Boot Web] Templating using [Thymeleaf]
7. [Spring AOP]
8. [Spring Mongo DB]
9. [Angular 2] uisng [Angular CLI]
10. Deploying the application using RedHat(tm) [Open Shift] (r)
11. [Open Shift] (r) [DIY] Cartige

# Index Page
This is more in construction phase as I was busy building the spring based backend API.
Now time to explore the [Angular 2] page and can expect a glaring page soon :)

>**_Disclaimer_**: I am using a free version of the [Open Shift] gear and if not accessed for more then 24hrs they will shutdown the cartige. In case you see the site to be down please click on http://shop-venkatvp.rhcloud.com/index.html and the site will start up by itself. This will bring all the services back into action in few minutes.
