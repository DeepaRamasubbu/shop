# Shop API
---

This is a carlessly written simple API that is implemented using [Spring Boot] and some of its associated project. The running application has been hosted on the [Open Shift(r) RedHat(r) Cloud][open shift]. [Spring Boot] is a nice little handy framwork that I have workd with and it is giving us the freedom to build quick and robust applications. This project was mainly created to learn the following concepts in around [Spring Boot].

1. [Swagger]
2. [Spring Testing]
3. [Spring Security]
4. [Spring Boot MVC Jackson]
5. [JMS consumer and producer using Apache ActiveMQ]
6. [Spring Boot Web] Templating using [Thymeleaf]
7. [Spring AOP]
8. [Spring Mongo DB]
9. [Angular 2] uisng [Angular CLI]
10. Deploying the application using RedHat(tm) [Open Shift] (r)
11. [Open Shift] (r) [DIY] Cartige
